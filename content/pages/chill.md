Enough about work and tech stuff, let's chill out for a bit.

## Music

It's not bluffing to say that music is my life. I'm crazy about it, I got playlists all over the internet :D. I usually listen to music while I'm working, walking, relaxing, taking a shower, etc. It's my everything. Here's a few public playlist. Have a listen hehe.

#### [Soundcloud] Say playlist

One of the best indie music platform and the chillest playlist I had.
