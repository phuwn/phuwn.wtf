Welcome fellow ðŸ‘‹, I'm Phuong Tran, a young and passionate engineer who believes programming can rewrite this world. I'm in my 20s and I'm trying my best to be a skilled **Backend engineer** or at least not to lose my job. By the way I'm currently a software **Intern** at [NFQ Asia](https://www.nfq.asia/), a good company tho. My main focus now is on developing and building secure, scalable system.

I love tech stuff and I have a lot of thoughts about them. I mean, tech world is a lot more than just coding and building stuff like we all think. And that's one of the main reasons why I build this blog, to find out the true meaning of tech world together, with you guys. Don't hesitate to share your opinion or talk about tech stuff. I'm open to all contribution.

A bit about myself:

- _Iâ€™m from Vietnam, a famous country in the warm South East Asia. I'm about to have a B.E from HCMUP LOL!!! Iâ€™m specialized in Software Development and currently a 5th-year student here at Ho Chi Minh City Pedagogical University (HCMUP). College is hard you know :(_

- _I had a summer internship at [Dwarves Foundation](https://dwarves.foundation/) in 2019 and stay there for a year being a **Backend engineer**. Most of the time there, I participated in developing **Fortress**, an internal business management tool and **Sol**, an unpublished travelogue product. This is also the place where I become a **Gopher** hehe._

- _I love music, books and mostly, boardgames. It helps us connect to each other. And secondly, it improves your logic-handling and mind-reading skills <("). You should probably try it once, especially the [One Night Ultimate Werewolf](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/147949/one-night-ultimate-werewolf/)._
- _I hope to be the person who dares to try new and unique things._
