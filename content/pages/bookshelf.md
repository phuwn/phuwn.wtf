Well, I do enjoy reading books. Some of them aren't even in coding or tech category. I read all kind of books including psychology, business, self-help, ... Hmm does manga count as books? Cause I read them like my entire life hehe. Anyway I thought Iâ€™d share my bookshelf here, check it out. Some of them I started but never finished ðŸ˜…. Those highlighted are my favorite, give them a try.

## In Progress

These are currently in my reading sack, read some and we could talk about them.

- [**The Courage To Be Disliked**](https://www.amazon.com/Courage-Be-Disliked-yourself-happiness-ebook/dp/B074TWG8V7) - A single book can change your life. It's about a conversation of a young man and a philosopher who believes the world is simple and happiness was within the reach of every man. Through that, it shows you how to free yourself, change your life and achieve real happiness.

- [**Go In Action**](https://www.amazon.com/Go-Action-William-Kennedy/dp/1617291781) - One of the best books about `golang` (**Go** programming language).
