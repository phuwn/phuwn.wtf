So I‚Äôve read some articles on Uses This and fell in love with this fascinating topic. For those who are not familiar with Uses This, it is a collection of nerdy interviews asking people from all walks of life what they use to get the job done. So today, I want to try it out and interview myself on this topic hehe. Have a read.

### **Phuong**

Software developer

### Who are you, and what do you do?

Hi, I‚Äôm [Phuong](https://phuwn.wtf), and I‚Äôm a software developer from Vietnam. I currently work for [NFQ Asia](https://www.nfq.asia/) as a Security Engineer. My day-to-day job is to make sure our system and our user‚Äôs data safe and healthy.

I‚Äôm also a would-be writer. Recently, I‚Äôve developed a love for writing and pushed myself to write more and more. I really am interested in sharing my thoughts with the world. Check it out if you have time. You can find my articles and my works at [phuwn.wtf](https://www.phuwn.wtf).

### What hardware do you use?

For years, my companions usually are Mac hardware. It has a cool UX, UNIX-based system (which is perfect for programming), beautiful design, HD graphic, and MacBook is considered as the best setup for remote working at the coffee shop hehe. So yeah, love it. My current partner is a MacBook Pro 2017 13-inch with a bunch of stickers on it. Up till now, he‚Äôs still doing really fine and I‚Äôll let him try the hardest he can until he can‚Äôt keep up with the tech race ü§ù.

### And what software?

About the OS, well, I use macOS on my MacBook, what else hehe. The current version is macOS Catalina (v10.15). And about my favorite software, It definitely is the terminal.

- First, I‚Äôm really in love with the beauty of command-line tools. It provides lightning-fast execution, handy and professional.

- And second, it stores all of your work feels like your own garage. Especially when you customize your terminal, it feels so warm and cozy. It can always motivate me to code and build more stuff.

My IDE is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), it‚Äôs kind of handy. And it supports pretty well with most of my programming language like Go, NodeJS, ‚Ä¶

For Security purposes, I use a lot of different tools like:

- [OWASP ZAP](https://owasp.org/www-project-zap/)

- [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp)

- [XSStrike](https://github.com/s0md3v/XSStrike)

- [sqlmap](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap)

For web browsing, I use Google Chrome. But I‚Äôm considering switching to some less-RAM-consuming browser, maybe Firefox, or Brave.

Most of my source code is stored on GitHub and I usually choose [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for my infrastructure.

### What would be your dream setup?

The new M1 MacBook really makes me curious tho, but I‚Äôm not that kind of guy who pays a generous budget for those greatest and latest technologies. I‚Äôm pretty happy with my current setup. Oh and I really love those high tables which you can work on while standing. I think it would help me protect my spine.

So a table, a MacBook, a cup of tea, and maybe some snack would be great.
