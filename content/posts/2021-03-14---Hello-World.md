Welcome folks, to my very first article.

![A whole wide world awaiting](/media/post_1_img_1.jpg)

Well‚Ä¶ Technically, this is not the first article I write. But it truly is the beginning article that I present to the world hehe. Hello, world!!!

For years, I had been struggling, like a lot, just to write and publish an article myself. What should I write? Where do I start? A knowledge-sharing post?? Am I that good to share? How about my work stories?? Nah my working day is boring. My new pet project? Hmm, maybe not‚Ä¶ Those kinds of stuff just go on and on and on and I keep hesitating. I do start to write some but I‚Äôm too embarrassed about my experience to publish. After all, I‚Äôm just a newborn baby in this tech world. But, one day, I read a [‚ÄúHello World‚Äù article](https://phmhuypht.medium.com/hello-world-96edb062b92b) by a friend of mine, and boom, it sparks my thought. Sharing experience means sharing my own experience. It doesn‚Äôt have to be so superb or fancy, just my point of view üëç. This opinion really gives me the courage to show my thoughts to the world. Really appreciated.

Now I‚Äôm so excited to write. There‚Äôs so much stuff I wanna share. My eight-hour day, my working experience, my thousand of ideas, or even my bookshelf, ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll write them all. Welcome, to my huge and crazy world. Have a read sometimes hehe.

And one more thing, don‚Äôt hesitate to share your opinion. I‚Äôm open to all contributions. Share with me your thoughts and it could be my new experience üòÅ. Thank you.
